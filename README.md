# RsyncWebUI üöÄ

RsyncWebUI is a web-based tool that makes it easy to synchronize folders across directories using `rsync`.  
It features a modern UI with live folder browsing, job history, and configurable sync options ‚Äî all running inside a lightweight Docker container.

---

## ‚ú® Features at a Glance
- Live browse your server directories
- Choose source and destination folders
- Customize rsync options
- Real-time sync output with live status
- View full sync history
- Re-run previous jobs
- Create new folders during browsing
- **Schedule one-time or recurring sync jobs**
- Dockerized for easy deployment!

---

## üõ† Requirements
- Docker installed (v20.10+)
- Docker Compose installed (v2+)
- Basic familiarity with local folders you want to sync

---

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone or pull the RsyncWebUI repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rubes78/RsyncWebUI.git
cd RsyncWebUI
```

> Or simply use the provided `docker-compose.yml` to pull directly!

---

### 2. Configure `.env` File

Example `.env`:
```env
DATA_PATH=/Quarks
USB_PATH=/USB
DOCKER_PATH=/HoloMedia/Dockers/rsyncwebui
PUID=1000
PGID=1000
# Optional configuration variables
# CONFIG_PATH=/app/config
# HISTORY_FILENAME=sync_history.json
# PATHS_FILENAME=saved_paths.json
# BROWSE_ROOT=/mnt/data
```

Required variables:
- `DATA_PATH`: Path to your first source folder (like /Quarks)
- `USB_PATH`: Path to your second source (like external drive /USB)
- `DOCKER_PATH`: Where to store RsyncWebUI's runtime config
- `PUID/PGID`: User and Group IDs for Docker permissions

Optional configuration variables:
- `CONFIG_PATH`: Directory for persistent JSON files (default: /app/config)
- `HISTORY_FILENAME`: Filename for sync history (default: sync_history.json)
- `PATHS_FILENAME`: Filename for saved paths (default: saved_paths.json)
- `SCHEDULED_JOBS_FILENAME`: Filename for scheduled jobs (default: scheduled_jobs.json)
- `BROWSE_ROOT`: Root directory for file browsing (default: /mnt/data)

---

### 3. Launch the WebUI

#### For Developers (local builds):
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env up --build
```

#### For Testers / Friends (GitHub Pull):
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env up --build
```

Then open your browser:
```
http://localhost:5050
```

‚úÖ You'll see the RsyncWebUI interface ready to go!

---

## üìÇ Accessing Host Folders
The Docker container mounts your `DATA_PATH` and `USB_PATH` into `/mnt/data/Quarks` and `/mnt/data/USB` respectively.
You can browse, sync, and manage these folders from the web interface.

---

## üíæ Persistent Storage
RsyncWebUI stores your sync history and saved paths in JSON files located in the mounted volume specified by `DOCKER_PATH` (mapped to `/app/config` inside the container). This ensures your data persists across container restarts and updates.

- `sync_history.json`: Contains a record of all your sync operations
- `saved_paths.json`: Stores your saved source and destination paths
- `scheduled_jobs.json`: Stores your scheduled sync jobs

You can customize the location and filenames of these files using the environment variables described in the configuration section.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Managing the Container

- Stop the WebUI:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```

- Rebuild after updates:
  ```bash
  docker compose up --build
  ```

- Restart cleanly:
  ```bash
  docker compose down && docker compose up --build
  ```

---

## üßπ Cleaning Up

Delete containers and images:
```bash
docker compose down --rmi all --volumes
```

## üìÖ Scheduling Sync Jobs
RsyncWebUI now supports scheduling sync jobs to run automatically at specified times:

### Types of Schedules
- **One-time**: Run a sync job once at a specific date and time
- **Recurring**: Set up jobs to run on a regular schedule:
  - **Hourly**: Every X hours
  - **Daily**: Every X days at a specific time
  - **Weekly**: On selected days of the week at a specific time
  - **Monthly**: On a specific day of the month at a specific time

### Managing Scheduled Jobs
1. Click on "Schedule Rsync Jobs" from the main page
2. Configure your source and destination paths
3. Set your rsync options
4. Choose your schedule type and configure the timing
5. Click "Schedule Sync" to create the job
6. View, edit, or delete your scheduled jobs from the table
